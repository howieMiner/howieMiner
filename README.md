# howieMiner
howieMiner is a Windows only build that will only work for AMD cards and only mines on ethermine.org pool.

I have increased the ethminer program by roughly 10-15% and the only charge is that 5% of every hour mines for me.

I have made it simpler to add in parameters to the bat file, please follow instructions in bat file.

I have made it much smaller than other ethereum mining programs, this is a mining on a ethermine pool only program.

The program runs the first 3 minutes for my wallet than 57 for the wallet input.  There is no option to run for my wallet all the time or your wallet for all the time.  If you don't want me getting 5% of your mining when you get a 10-15% increase, do not use this program.  I bare no responsibility for any type of damage or any type of loss that is caused from running this program.  All risk and responsibility lies with the person that runs the program.

There are other stages that I am going to work on:

Stage 2: Make a Linux version of the same program.

Stage 3: Modify program so that it can mine to two of your wallets based on a percentage told.  This would be helpful if you and a partner chipped in for mining equipment.

Stage 4: update program to new ethminer standards.

email me at howieMiner@pm.me if you have any true suggestions.  I will block any ridiculous statements.
